\section{Introduction}
With the rapid development of science and technology, artificial intelligence has also ushered in new 
development opportunities. Machine technology based on computer technology incorporates 
multidisciplinary theoretical knowledge, such as statistics and algorithm complexity, which further 
strengthens the functional attributes of artificial intelligence. By doing a reasonable analysis of 
machine learning algorithms, it can provide direction reference for subsequent machine learning 
development, thereby improving the applicability of machine learning algorithms and providing more 
convenience for the economic development of the industry.
\section{Basic Classification of Machine Learning
}
2.1. Supervised Learning
In the process of machine learning, supervised learning belongs to a relatively basic learning method. 
This learning method refers to the establishment of corresponding learning goals by people before 
learning. During the initial training of the machine, the machine relies on information technology to 
learn the needs of learning. In order to collect basic data information, we are supposed to gradually 
complete the required learning content in a supervised environment. Compared with other learning 
methods, supervised learning can fully stimulate the generalized learning potential of the machine 
itself. After completing the system learning, it can help people to solve some classification or 
regression problems, which is highly systematic. Currently, the classic learning methods commonly 
used include BN, SVN, KNN, etc. Because the entire learning process has purpose, the machine 
learning process presents a certain regularity, and the learning content is more systematic [1].

2.2. Unsupervised Learning
Corresponding to supervised learning is unsupervised learning. The so-called unsupervised learning 
means that the machine does not mark the content in a certain direction during the entire learning 
process, but rely on the machine itself to complete the analysis of data information. In practice, the 
operation method is to let the machine learn the basic concepts and content, and then give the machine 
enough freedom to complete a series of content learning, including concepts and content similar to the 
basic principles, such as tree roots. In general, the continuous improvement of learning in stages has 
increased the breadth of machine learning content. At present, unsupervised learning includes 
algorithms such as deep belief networks and autoencoders. Such situations are conducive to the 
solution of clustering problems and have good applications in the development of many industries [2].

2.3. Reinforcement Learning
In addition to supervised learning and unsupervised learning, there are also application methods of 
reinforcement learning in machine learning. The so-called reinforcement learning is the systematic 
learning of a certain content. In the specific application process, the data collected in the previous 
period will be used. It organizes and processes the feedback information of a certain part to form a 
closed loop of data processing. On the whole, reinforcement learning is a type of learning method that 
expands data collection based on statistics and dynamic learning. Such methods are mainly used to 
solve the control problem of robots. Its representative learning methods include Q-learning algorithm 
and Temporal difference learning algorithm
\section{Analysis of Commonly Used Algorithms for Machine Learning}
3.1. Decision Tree Algorithm
Among the commonly used algorithms for machine learning, the decision tree algorithm belongs to 
the classic algorithm content. Its working principle is that when processing data information, it starts 
from the root node of the collection instance and reaches the position where the nodes meet to make it 
complete. Scientific division of practical examples. In order to facilitate the analysis of data 
information, the decision number algorithm will continue to split branches, and at the same time, the 
branches will be trimmed to improve the integrity of the data content [3]. From the point of view of 
calculation, the algorithm belongs to the top-down algorithm. During the content analysis process, the 
content of the node is analyzed for the optimal attributes, and then the node is expanded to more than 
two based on the node. This way, you can get comprehensive data information of the split, and the 
branching method like a tree can also increase the number of samples that can be analyzed, and at the 
same time determine the content that contains the most samples in the classification according to the 
sample number statistics. For example, when analyzing data, you can name the decision tree with a 
large amount of data information as the larger tree A, and set the upper limit of branch splitting. If the 
upper limit is set to 5, the larger tree A is in the classification after reaching the value of 5, it will 
stop continuing to split, and at the same time use the pruning strategy to process the larger tree model, 
so as to refine the data and improve the scientificity of the data analysis results.
3.2. Random Forest Algorithm
Similar to the decision tree algorithm, in the process of data calculation, the random forest algorithm 
can be used for further processing. The random forest algorithm will play a good role in controlling 
unreasonable data in the process of actual use. Thereby effectively improving the scientificity of the 
data split results and the accuracy of the data analysis results. At the same time, in the process of data 
analysis, multiple sets of classification trees will be created at the same time, and then the unified 
algorithm will be used for regression processing. Assuming the decision tree is an independent set ai (i 
= 1,2,3 ... n), then the random forest is the total set A, where A = {a1, a2, a3, ..., an}, where a = 1,2,3 ... 
n. Each set remains independent, and the distribution is a state of random distribution. When 
evaluating the classification data information, it will be selected by means of voting. The classification 
with the highest number of votes in the voting will output the vector value xi, and then the vector 
content will be classified to calculate the average value of different score states and provide data 
reference for the final judgment [4].

\section{Research on Machine Learning Development}
4.1. Theoretical System Continues to Mature
In the future development process, the mechanical theory system will also be further optimized, and its 
content branches and coverage will also be expanded. In the initial formulation process of machine 
learning content, its content is mainly applicable to some automation industries, and the content of the 
entire theoretical system has not been completely sound. In practical application, the content of its 
theoretical system is not applicable in some fields. In response to such situations, the next stage of 
machine learning theory will be continuously strengthened, and the degree of refinement of the content 
will also be strengthened, which provides convenient conditions for the subsequent promotion of 
machine learning.

\section{Conclusion}
In summary, machine learning is still in its infancy, and it mainly relies on supervised learning, and 
does not fully overcome weak artificial intelligence. Relevant personnel need to constantly improve 
the theoretical foundation and practice of machine learning. In the corresponding scientific field and 
the development of computer technology, we should provide a good environment for machine learning, 
and the development prospect of machine learning is very broad. In addition, it is also necessary to 
actively learn from the experiences and lessons of developed countries, set up machine algorithms 
suitable for the development of domestic enterprises, and provide technical support for the economic 
development of the industry.
